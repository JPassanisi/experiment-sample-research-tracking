You can install MissingLink.AI via Python package manager, pip, which should already be installed if you are using Python 2>=3.4 Python 3=2.7.9
^--- Text can be simpler

Star Coding/Run example
^--- Should be buttons not radio buttons.

Which framework are you using?
^--- Should have a "other" field so we can get data

Import the SDK and define your credentials at the beginning of the file (before any function definition).
^--- Keep it short and simple please


Now you can create a KerasCallback instance with your credentials, which helps to monitor the experiment in real time. Right before the model.fit function, add the following statements.
^-- shorten and fix grammar
^-- combine this with the paste of the import, one less stage


Modify the model.fit function to the following statement.
^-- wtf? has nothing to do with the paste.
^-- why is the astronaut angry with me?


Pass the callback that you have just created to Keras.
^-- support more types of `fit`, perhaps survey what real users have this line  say.

Add A Test Scope
^-- If it's called `model.evaluate` then that should be the title. E.g. "Track model evaluations".

Which are optional which are mandatory?

Why org? Why not PROJECT_TOKEN and OWNER_ID?

Data management

Waiting for your data to sync
^---How do I use my s3 instead of uploading from my pc?

What is "commit"?
What is "unstage"?
Why?
Where did the wizard go?

What do I do now?

What's the query syntax?

What's the code snippet?

If the wizard is partial - it might be harmful. Link to the docs.

-- MAKE IT OBVIOUS YOU DO NOT CONSTRUCT MALI DATA CLONE
-- you copy paste it...

"Running the following command"
is useless to repeat

`mali data clone` is it cached? It's slow...

$ mali data clone 5685154290860032 --query '@version:f6f90ef73a86ab88f5dfec00433038555ad9a508 @sample:0.05 @seed:1337' --destFolder './mldx2/$dir' --destFile '$name' 
Did I fuck that up or did the sample?
I got mldx/train/Training/


===========
Overall feedback

The wizard should not start with a first step.
It should start with a motivator.
